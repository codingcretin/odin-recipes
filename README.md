Okay, I hope I've done it right this time. No JSON file added so I think that's a good sign.
It's now about 2 in the morning and it's taken me far too long to get this far. 
I think I messed up the process a bit in the command line..
Really hope it works this time, at least I got a lot of practice imputting those git commands. Hopefully I will be able to look back on this in the not too distant future and see that I've made progress.
